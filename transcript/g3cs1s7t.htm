<p class="bodyblack">We have been undertaking
  mining operation[s] to a limited extent but now
  that the Anglesey Siege Engineer Company has arrived
  with a lot of miners from Lancashire we shall
  be able to make good progress – the only mine
  we have yet dug had the desired effect of
  making the enemy cease his sap. Small night
  raids against the enemy's sap heads by parties
  dressed in white night things had the best
  effect on the same where they were quite
  invisible – The 7 Div are good at these minor
  enterprises and the 8 Div though green are learning
  the tricks of the trade – The young officers we have
  taken out of the ranks of the Artists are doing first
  class with the regular bat[talion] and the cry is &quot;give us
  more of them&quot;

<p class="bodyblack">These Germans can fight and whatever
  may be said about their second line troops
  they know their work and are no mean
  opponents. They have thought everything out
  to the last detail and when it comes to
  this trench fighting which none could have
  foreseen with any certainty they produce a
  trench mortar and hand bombs which
  are decidedly better than anything that either
  we or the French have so far been able to
  make. When last Friday night I managed
  to capture some 500 yards of their
  trench line, at two different points, they
  attacked the Scots Guards and W. Yorkshire
  Reg with hand bombs and succeeded in
  driving them out of the captured trenches
  back again to our own line. These bombs
  have quite an important explosion and if
  they fall in the trench as they frequently do
  they either kill or wound any men who
  happen to be between the two traverses
  The German Pioneers are specially trained to
  use them and after crawling up the narrow
  communication trenches, they throw these
  bombs with great accuracy and rapidity.
  They also have a trench mortar something
  that the Japs used which sends a good
  big high explosive shell some 150 to 200
  yards. If it falls in the trench which
  it seldom does it makes a great mess of
  it, if it falls near (within a few yards) of
  the trench its concussion shakes in any
  part that is unrevetted.  We are in bad
  need of an answer to these weapons.</p>

<p class="bodyblack">The chief facts, that
  have come out most prominently and which
  constitute the chief lessons of this are,
  firstly the accuracy and smashing effect of
  the art[iller]y fire, and secondly the success of the
  bomb throwers in grenadier companies as
  we call them. They really did excellent
  work in the trenches and hunted the
  Germans out of whole lengths of trench until
  they stumbled on a machine gun which
  they could not deal with successfully. The
  German Machine Guns are admirably handled.
  They push them back and forward and choose
  their positions most skilfully, indeed more
  than half our casualties have been due
  to the fire of machine guns. They are most
  difficult to discover even when firing and
  are usually so placed as to be displaced from
  the front so that our guns cannot knock
  them out. So far we have not been
  able to find a satisfactory antidote to them
  but we hope that with rifle bombs fired at
  point blank range, and light trench mortars
  carried forward with the attack we may
  in future be able to cope with them better
  than in the past. The art[iller]y, which was
  admirably handled by Gen Holland VIII Div
  and Uniacke army the groups of heavies, did really
  effective work. The 9.2 &amp; 6&quot; How[itzer]s were
  the most effective and accurate guns we
  had for &quot;Grand Mama,&quot; as we have named
  the 15&quot;,  had some difficulty in getting her
  shells to burst. I was told that 17 of the
  27 shots she fired, failed to explode!!!
  We are looking forward to the arrival of
  the 8&quot; and 12&quot; Howitzers. They are the
  guns that will help us most if they are
  really accurate but they must be able to
  put their shells within 5 yards of a trench in
  order to knock out the defenders.
