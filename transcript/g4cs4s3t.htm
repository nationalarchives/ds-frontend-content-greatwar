            <td width="100%" align="left"><p class="bodyblackindent">1.	THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff, who had just
              returned from France, reported that there was not much information
              in addition to that which the War Cabinet had already received.
              Enemy resistance was stiffening all along the line, and neither
              Marshal Foch nor Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig proposed to make
              further attacks for the present unless they could advance without
              undue expenditure of life. The Allied Generals were, however,
              testing one or two places which they particularly wished to capture,
              because it seemed that if these places were taken the enemy would
              be obliged to fall back farther. It would be seen in the course of
              the next forty-eight hours whether these operations were worth
              undertaking.</p>

<p class="bodyblackindent">The Chief of the Imperial General Staff continued that he had
  seen General Currie. He had also seen General Monash,
  commanding the Australians, with his five Divisional Generals, who
  were all much pleased with the result of their recent operations,
  more especially with the smallness of the losses incurred. The
  casualties of each of the five Divisional Generals had only amounted
  to about 600 apiece. The casualties of the enemy, on the other
  hand, appeared to have been very heavy, because the Germans had
  been pushed back so rapidly that they could not get away owing to
  the congestion of the roads. The total number of German prisoners
  taken by the British and French in these operations amounted to
  about 30,000, together with some 400 to 500 guns. The total losses
  of the Allies had been about 30,000, of which British losses were
  about 20,000.</p>

<p class="bodyblackindent">The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the tanks had
  done splendid work. The number of tanks put out of action,
  whether lost or disabled, amounted to about 60 per cent. of the
  total, but many of these were not lost of the enemy, and could be
  repaired shortly. The temporary casualties to tanks were due
  chiefly to engine troubles and over-heating. The tank personnel
  had done very well, but it had become clear that there must be two
  or three relays of personnel, owing to the fact that the crews
  became exhausted in the intense heat inside the tanks.</p>

<p class="bodyblackindent">Asked as to whether he considered it probable that the enemy
  would make a stand on the Vesle, General Wilson replied that he
  thought so. He added that their position would be so uncomfortable
  that he had from the first favoured the idea of leaving them there,
  and he believed that this was Marshal Foch's intention, but that it
  was not unlikely that the Germans would before long re-cross the
  Aisne.</p>

<p class="bodyblackindent">The enemy appeared to have nineteen reserve divisions, of
  which fifteen were with Prince Rupprecht, two with the Crown
  Prince, and two with Prince Albrecht.</p>
<p class="bodyblackindent">Proof of the deterioration of the enemy was evidenced in the
  fact that the 1st Australian Division, with but small losses to
  themselves, had so completely knocked out the 5th Bavarian Division
  that, in the opinion of the Australian Commanders, it seemed unlikely
  that the latter unit would be able to recover for two months.
