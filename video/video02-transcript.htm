<h2>We were still wearing tropical kit</h2> 
   <p>Funny thing is, we weren’t here to start with. No we was  first posted to Egypt. Imagine that, all these lads from Yorkshire mines out  there with the sand and the pyramids and all that. We was there to look after  the Suez Canal because the Generals was expecting Johnny Turk to attack it any  day. Only no one seems to have told Johnny Turk about it because he never  turned up. So we were shifted back here to France in Spring of last year, 1916,  to take part in big push. In fact when they put us into trenches for first time  in April, we were still wearing tropical kit. Even with pith helmets. </p>
   <p>Soon we exchanged it all for one of these, this is your  steel helmet, your tin hat, very useful for stopping shrapnel. When a shell  explodes metal fragments go flying everywhere and do terrible things to a  fellas body, so you protect your head by always wearing your tin hat. But it  does have other uses as well. Uses perhaps that er, the government haven’t  thought about. Cos look here at this tin hat here. You might say to yourself,  you could use it as a bowl, or you could use it to drink out of, eat out of, or  maybe you wouldn’t want to if you know what we sometimes do eat. Because er,  suppose you might say that this is bit of a mobile toilet. Cos we do have  toilets here or the army word for them is latrines. Now we have latrines here  in the trenches, erm and depending on the state of the trench depends on the  state of your latrines to be honest. </p>
   <p>The problem is with your latrines, is from the air they look  a bit like mortar emplacements. So when Fritz over there wants to find a target  to shell, he might send a mate of his over in an aeroplane. He flies over your  trench, looks down at your latrines and says goodness me, that’s a mortar  emplacement, I must tell my friend in artillery. He tells his mate and they  shell your toilets. Now let’s face it, none of us want to be caught with our  trousers down now do we. So if we’re getting a heavy pasting, as we can do,  which is frightening, terrifying, you really don’t want to be going and sitting  on the toilet. So in that case, if it comes out of the front end you do it in  the trench, if it comes out back end, you do it in your helmet. Now when you’re  done, you chuck it into no man’s land and then wipe off using, er, oh I don’t  know whatever might come to hand, a shirt tail, bit of grass, something like  that. If you don’t mind I’m going to put this back on my head right now cos I  feel a bit nervous having my helmet off. </p>
   <p>Because even on a quiet day like today, you never know when  it might get you. They say that you never know your bullet or shell with your  name on it, you know and it can happen at any time. You can get shelled, hit by  a canister bomb, mortar, grenade, you can be hit by a snipers bullet, you can  be machine gunned, you could be gassed, you could even be blown up from  underneath, cos Germans they tunnel underneath no man’s Land , underneath our  trenches and then blow them up and we do the same to them. So even that might  happen to you. Just while you’re sitting here. It’s happened to me many times  when I’ve been sitting next to a mate or something, having a bit of natter with  him, zip and he’s hit and he’s dead.                    </p>
