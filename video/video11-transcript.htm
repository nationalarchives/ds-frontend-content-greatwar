<h2>Comes the order to fix bayonets</h2> 
   <p>You can’t help yourself thinking about it. Before you go  into the line you can’t help thinking to yourself, well, maybe tomorrow I will  die. Or if I don’t die will I get wounded? And if I am wounded, how serious  will it be? Will I lose an arm? Will I lose a leg? Will I have to live rest of  my life in a wheelchair? Will I be disfigured? All these thoughts is going  through your mind and you find yourself often just sort of sitting down, just  for yourself you know. I mean lots of fellas do different things. You know you  might be playing games you know, betting your wages on a throw of a dice, or  playing cards or having a quiet smoke. Quick prayer perhaps, chatting with your  friends and well what you should do of course is you take out your pay book.  Your pay book is in breast pocket here. Take it out and in the back of your pay  book you have your will. Now you write down there where you want all your  belongings to go should you not come back. Because when you pick up the dead,  what you do is you cut open the breast pocket and you take out the pay book so  you know whose fella’s it is and you know where to send all his kit. Now when  you go into line next day, you’ll get down there and of course you won’t see  where you’re going because you’ve just got the trench wall in front of you. You  know, you’ll be hearing the barrage go off beforehand and you’ll be thinking,  well, it’ll be me soon. And I’ll be honest you’re shaking, you are you’re  fearful. Know I see other fellas faces and I can see them all white and pale,  but still we’re remembering why we’re here, remembering what we’ve got to do  and we’re determined to do it. Then of course comes the order to fix bayonets.  So you grip your rifle, take out your bayonet and you attach it onto the end of  your rifle and you wait next to the ladders waiting to go. </p>
   <p>Now one thing they do give you before you go over the top is  a tot of rum, that’s to sharpen your resolve as it were. Mind you this rum  isn’t the sort of rum that you’re going to get at home. This is service rum. That’s  means that probably- well, what did one fella describe it as? Our corporal  called it liquid sunshine, that was it. That’s a good phrase, that’s what it  feels like. It really wakes you up as it were. One thing I didn’t like though,  was that in our trench also, first time I went over, they had military  policeman there to make sure we did what we were supposed to do. I didn’t like  that. Didn’t need to be told what we had to do. We was ready.</p>
